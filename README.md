# Battle-of-Wits-3-in-1-Game
This Python game combines Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS). Players guess letters for Hangmanâ€”correct guesses allow a Tic-Tac-Toe move, while wrong guesses trigger an RPS match to save their turn. The game ends when Tic-Tac-Toe is won or the Hangman word is fully guessed, creating a fun and strategic experience.
